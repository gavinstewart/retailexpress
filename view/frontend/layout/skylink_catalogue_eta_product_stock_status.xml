    When this handle is loaded due to the setting of ETA configuration through
    \RetailExpress\SkyLink\Observer\Catalogue\Eta\WhenLayoutIsLoading
    we will replace occurances of the regular "in stock"/"out of stock" templates
    with our own overrides.

    We're basing our overrides off the default Magento output, however your theme
    might override these templates (without changing them). In that case, it's
    likely the HTML that's outputted by this extension won't match your theme.

    To restore compatibility, you'll need to either:

      (a) Copy conflicting files to the same location within your theme and resolve issues manually.
      (b) Set the template back to the original template and introduce ETA functionality.

    Either way is appropriate, however option (a) is recommended as it decouples your theme from ETA.
